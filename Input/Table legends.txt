Name - Name of the planet. This links to the data of the planet at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
Type - PHL's classification of planets that includes host star spectral type (F, G, K, M), habitable zone location (hot, warm, cold) and size (miniterran, subterran, terran, superterran, jovian, neptunian) (e.g. Earth = G-Warm Terran, Venus = G-Hot Terran, Mars = G-Warm Subterran).
Mass - Mass of the planet in Earth masses (Earth = 1.0 ME).
Radius - Radius of planet in Earth radii (Earth = 1.0 RE).
Flux - Average stellar flux of the planet in Earth fluxes (Earth = 1.0 SE).
Teq - Equilibrium temperature in kelvins (K) assuming a 0.3 bond albedo (Earth = 255 K). Surface temperatures are expected to be larger than the equilibrium temperature depending on the atmosphere, which are currently unknown (e.g. Earth mean global surface temperature is about 288 K or 15Â°C).
Period - Orbital period in days (Earth = 365 days).
Distance - Distance from Earth in light-years (ly).
ESI - Earth Similarity Index, a measure of similarity to Earth's stellar flux, mass, and/or radius (Earth = 1.0). Results are sorted by this number. Planets more similar to Earth are not necessarily more habitable, since the ESI does not consider all factors necessary for habitability.
